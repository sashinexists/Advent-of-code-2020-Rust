    "first": "\\--- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---\n----------\n\nSanta was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's \"snow\" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect *fifty stars* by December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants *one star*. Good luck!\n\nHere's an easy puzzle to warm you up.\n\nSanta is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.\n\nAn opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.\n\nThe apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.\n\nFor example:\n\n* `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.\n* `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.\n* `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.\n* `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).\n* `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.\n\nTo *what floor* do the instructions take Santa?\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](1/input).\n\nAnswer:"
